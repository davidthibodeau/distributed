/** 
 * Simplified version from CSE 593 Univ. of Washington
 *
 * Distributed  System in Java.
 * 
 * failure reporting is done using two pieces, exceptions and boolean 
 * return values.  Exceptions are used for systemy things. Return
 * values are used for operations that would affect the consistency
 * 
 * If there is a boolean return value and you're not sure how it 
 * would be used in your implementation, ignore it.  I used boolean
 * return values in the interface generously to allow flexibility in 
 * implementation.  But don't forget to return true when the operation
 * has succeeded.
