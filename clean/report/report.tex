\section{The System}

Our system is split into three different layers: the client which takes 
user inputs and formats them into queries that it sends to the server; 
the middleware which receives queries from the clients and coordinate 
their execution and handling with the resource managers; the resource 
managers which each keeps track of a particular resource. There are 
four of them: cars, flights, rooms, and customers. The system can create 
different resources; have customers reserve cars, rooms or flights; 
queries the price or the number of available items of that resource. 
These operations make the system into an actual itinerary reservation 
system.

The middleware coordinates user queries through the use of transactions 
which allow a series of operations to be done in an all or nothing 
fashion. Those transactions are done through a lock manager that allows 
only a single transaction to be able to change values of a resource at 
any given time, and through a transaction manager that coordinate the 
commit or abortion of a given transaction.

\subsection{Uses of Java's RMI}

Our implementation uses Java's Remote Method Interfaces. We have set up
interfaces to indicate to the remote program what are the local methods 
it can use. The middleware implements the \java{ResourceManager} interface. 
The resource managers implement one of \java{RMCar}, \java{RMFlight}, 
\java{RMHotel}, or \java{RMCustomer} which all extend the base interface 
\java{RMBase}. \java{RMBase} is the interface used by the base class
\java{RMBaseImpl} which as parent class for the implementations of
each of the ressource managers. This class implements the hashtable
and operations that are common to all the RMs like \java{readData},
\java{writeData}, and \java{reserveItem}.

To start the implementation, we first need to start the RMs. They take
as optional input a port number. If none is provided, they assume the
port 1099 is used for the rmiregistry (which needs to be started on
the local machine). The middleware then takes as arguments the name of
the machines running RMCar, RMFlight, RMHotel, and RMCustomer,
respectively. It also takes a port number as an optional argument. For
simplicity, it will take a single port number and will try to reach
all the RMs on this port, in addition to setting himself to listen to
that port. This limitation requires us to start all the rmiregistries
on the same port. This, however, simplifies the parsing of the input
for the middleware. We have had some trouble connecting to a
rmiregistry that was not already started. In particular, it could not
see the RMBase interface even if it was there. It seems to be linked to
having the CLASSPATH variable set when the rmiregistry is started.
Then, the client is started and takes the name of the server running
the middleware together with an optional port number.

\section{Transactions}

Transactions are used to be able to make sure a series of operations is 
handled together. To do this, we use a lock manager, and we implement
two-phase commits through a transaction manager.

\subsection{From the RMs' Point of View\label{sec:rm}}

Write operations are done lazily in the RMs. The base class for the RMs, 
\java{RMBaseImpl} contains a new hashtable \java{m_transactionHT} which 
uses transaction IDs as keys, and contains hashtables as values. Those 
hashtables contain the changes made to the items by the existing 
transactions. When the transaction manager tells them to commit a 
transaction, the RM will simply write to the main hashtale the content 
of the hashtable of the particular transaction. Then, it will write
the main hashtable to a file for recovery as it is explained in
section~\ref{sec:recrm}.

The method \java{readData} will try to find the item in the hashtable 
of the transaction first. If it isn't there, it will do a deep copy of 
the item and gives this copy back. The \java{readData} method appears
in figure~\ref{fig:readdata}. Then, if the RM modifies the item, 
the original one will stay the same. The method \java{writeData} will 
simply write the item to the hashtable of the transaction. The method 
\java{removeData} will simply flag the item to be deleted and add it 
to the transaction hashtable.

\begin{figureone}{\java{readData} method in RMCarImpl.java \label{fig:readdata}}
\begin{lstlisting}
protected RMItem readData( int id, String key )
{
  synchronized(m_transactionHT){
    RMHashtable trHT = (RMHashtable) m_transactionHT.get(id);
    if(trHT != null){
      RMItem item = (RMItem) trHT.get(key);
      if(item != null)
      return item;
    }
  }
  synchronized(m_itemHT) {
    Car c = (Car) m_itemHT.get(key);
    if (c != null)
    return new Car(c);
    return null;
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{figureone}

If the transaction is aborted, its hashtable is simply discarded. If 
it is committed, the commit will write all elements of the hashtable 
of the transaction to the main hashtable. The items with the deleted 
tags will simply be removed from the main hashtable.

We note that if someone does modify an item, then noone else will try 
to access it is committed since noone else has a reading lock. It is 
thus safe to have a hashtable by id since there will be only one modified 
copy in only one of the hashtables and it is the only one that will be 
accessed. If multiple have a copy in their hashtable, then those copies 
will only be read.

\subsection{Lock Manager}

The lock manager is used to make sure the data is kept consistent
between different transactions. To do this, it gives shared read locks
and exclusive write locks on the different resources.

The lock manager follows mostly the provided code. It indexes locks it 
gives to objects in two ways: the object that is being locked and the 
transaction holding the lock. It has a waiting list for the transactions 
that want a lock and it will raise a deadlock exception if a given delay 
is passed. We extended the lock manager to handle the upgrade of locks 
from read lock to write lock.

\subsection{Transaction Manager}

The transaction manager keeps track of the transactions and of the 
resource managers involved in this transaction. Each time a write lock
is asked for the transaction, the transaction manager will add the
corresponding resource manager to its list of enlisted RMs. It then
coordinate the commits and aborts of the transactions with the RMs.

The TM uses \java{Transaction} objects which extend the class 
\java{TransactionData}. The latter only keeps persistent informations
as explained in section~\ref{sec:rectm}.
The former is implemented as an inner class of the TM to give to
the Time-To-Live mechanism (TTL) the access to some fields kept by
the TM. The details are presented in section~\ref{sec:ttl}.

A transaction object contains the transaction ID, together with wrappers
for each of the RMs to tell whether or not they are enlisted and what
is their current status for the two-phase commit as explained in the
\ref{sec:2pc}~section. It also contains the TTL presented below.

The transaction manager stores all transactions in an hashtable using 
the transaction ID as key. It also keeps the RMI objects for each RM 
obtained from the Middleware when the transaction manager is created. 
The RMIs are used to coordinate with them to commit/abort/shutdown.

It creates a new transaction object when its \java{start} method is 
called, giving it a new unique ID that is sent back to the Middleware, 
then to the client. It can commit and abort transactions with the 
corresponding methods. \java{abort} will simply remove the transaction 
object from the hashtable and call the abort method from the enlisted 
RMs to have them discard the writes they kept in store. \java{commit}
implements two-phase commits as presented below.

\subsubsection{Two-Phase Commit \label{sec:2pc}}

On commit, the transaction manager will start a two-phase commit
protocol. It will first ask every resource manager involved in the
transaction whether they are ready to commit through the \java{prepare}. 
The resource managers will write to a file the hashtable containing 
all the modified objects for this particular transaction, as presented 
in section~\ref{sec:rm}.

The TM will call the \java{prepare} in different threads which will set 
flags in the transaction object. There are two flags that are used: the
first one tells the TM that a given RM has answered while the second
tells it what the answers is. The TM will wait in a loop until all
the enlisted RMs have replied, or until a timeout is reached. If the 
timeout is reached, it will abort the transaction. This is shown in
figure~\ref{fig:prep}.

\begin{figureone}{\java{commit} method in TMimpl.java \label{fig:prep}}
\begin{lstlisting}
public boolean commit(int transactionID) 
      throws InvalidTransactionException, TransactionAbortedException {
  Transaction t = readData(transactionID);
  if (t == null)
  throw new InvalidTransactionException();
  t.timeoutReset();
  for (RMType rm : RMType.values()) {
    if (t.isEnlisted(rm)) {
      PrepareThread th = new PrepareThread(rm, t);
      th.start(); //asks every enlisted RM to prepare and vote
    }
  }
  
  try {
    t.timeoutStart();
    while (!t.isReady()) { // Not all RMs have voted
      if (t.isTimedOut()) { 
        abort(transactionID); //Time is out. Aborting 
        throw new TransactionAbortedException(transactionID);
      }
    Thread.sleep(1000);
    }
    Trace.info("TM::commit(" + transactionID + ") all replied.");
    if (t.voteResult()) { //All RMs voted, what is the result?
      //handling of commit in case of passed vote
    } else { //handling of abort in case of failed vote
    }
  } //Some catch statement afterward
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{figureone}

Once it gets all the votes, it will tell them to commit, or abort, the 
transaction if the vote passes, or fails, respectively. The resource
managers will then proceed.

\subsubsection{Time-To-Live Mechanism\label{sec:ttl}}

The transaction manager handles a TTL which is used to abort inactive 
transactions from crashed or idle clients. It is defined as an inner 
class within the Transaction class and contains a timer and an extension 
of the class \java{TimerTask}. On tick, the timer task will run and abort 
the transaction, giving up all the locks the transactions held. 

Each time an operation involves this transaction, the \java{lives} method 
from the transaction manager will retreive the transaction and call its 
\java{resetTTL} method. This method will cancel the current timer, 
preventing it from start the scheduled task, and create another one, 
rescheduling the task.

The inactivity delay is defined by the constant life. The current 
implementation sets it to 2 minutes (120 seconds) but it can easily be 
modified.

\begin{figureone}{\java{TimeToLive} class in TMimpl.java \label{fig:ttl}}
\begin{lstlisting}
class TimeToLive {

  private Timer timer;
  private final long life = 120; //in seconds; 2 min.
  
  TimeToLive() {
    timer = new Timer();
    timer.schedule(new RemindTask(), life*1000);
  }
  
  class RemindTask extends TimerTask {
    public void run() {
      try {
	synchronized(lock){
	  lock.UnlockAll(id);
	}
	abort(id);
      } catch (Exception e) {
	// Should not happen
	e.printStackTrace();
      }
      timer.cancel(); //Terminate the timer thread
    }
  }	
  
  void reset(){
    timer.cancel();
    timer = new Timer();
    timer.schedule(new RemindTask(), life*1000);
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{figureone}


\subsubsection{Autocommitting Transactions}

The server implements an autocommitting mechanism. A client can use the autocommit command to obtain a transaction ID that will perform autocommitting transactions, that is, each query will form its own transaction. It will obtain the necessary locks, perform the operations, then the middleware will ask the transaction manager to commit those changes and will release the locks. 

This autocommit feature appears as a flag in the transaction object. Such object does not have a TTL timer since they are noone possibly waiting for this transaction to finish. Moreover, committing or aborting any of its transactions will not remove the transaction object and so the ID can be used to do any number of autocommitting operations.  

\section{Coordination from the Middleware}

The middleware, as before, acts as coordinator between the client and the resources managers. It receives the queries from the clients and will use the lock manager to give locks for the given transactions. Figure~\ref{fig:operation} shows the \java{deleteCars} method and illustrates the coordination done by the middleware. If the locks can be given, it will tell the RMs to do the given operations. 

\begin{figureone}{\java{deleteCars} method in Middleware.java \label{fig:operation}}
\begin{lstlisting}
public boolean deleteCars(int id, String location)
    throws RemoteException, InvalidTransactionException, TransactionAbortedException {
  try{
    boolean b = acquireLock(id, RMType.CAR, Car.getKey(location), LockManager.WRITE);
    boolean b1 = rmCar.deleteCars(id, location);
    if(!b)
      commit(id);
    return b1;
  } catch (TransactionAbortedException i) {
    abort(id);
    throw new TransactionAbortedException(id);
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{figureone}

The obtention of the lock is done through the method \java{acquireLock} which is presented in figure~\ref{fig:acquireLock}. This method will tell the transaction manager that the transaction is still alive (resetting its TTL timer), then will verify if a lock can be given. If the lock can be given, and it is a write lock, it will tell the transaction manager to enlist the corresponding RM. If it cannot obtain the lock, a \java{DeadlockException} will be raised and it will then abort the whole transaction by raising \java{TransactionAbortedException}. The method returns a boolean obtained from \java{tm.lives} indicating whether or not the operation is done for a transaction in autocommitted mode. This mode is described in a subsection below.

\begin{figureone}{\java{acquireLock} method in Middleware.java \label{fig:acquireLock}}
\begin{lstlisting}
private boolean acquireLock(int id, RMType type, String key, int lockType) 
    throws TransactionAbortedException, InvalidTransactionException {
  try {
    boolean b = tm.lives(id);
    boolean locked = false;
    synchronized(lock){
      locked = lock.Lock(id, key, lockType);
    }
    if (locked) {
      if(lockType == LockManager.WRITE)
      tm.enlist(id, type);
      return b;
    } else{
      throw new InvalidTransactionException();
    }
  } catch (DeadlockException e) {
    throw new TransactionAbortedException(id);
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{figureone}

The middleware also receives the start/commit/abort requests from the client. For the start operation, it simply forwards the query to the transaction manager, gettin from it a transaction ID that is sent back to the client. During commit/abort operations, it simply unlocks all the locks held by the transaction, then passes control to the transaction manager to handle the rest of the commit/abort.

\section{Recovery Mechanisms}

The system implements saving to and loading from persistent storage to 
ensure recovery of data after a shutdown or a crash. It is done at two 
different places. The first one is at the transaction manager side where 
we keep track of the transaction data necessary to handle commits or 
aborts of preexisting transactions on reboot. The second place is in the 
resource managers where we save not only the hashtable containing all 
the resources handled by the RM, but also the modifications done by
a transaction that is prepared to be committed.

\subsection{Shutting Down the Server}

The server can go in shutdown mode if a client uses the shutdown command. 
The middleware will unbind itself from the RMI registry to prevent new 
transactions. Then, it will pass the control to the transaction manager 
which will abort all remaining transactions. It will then tell the RMs 
to shutdown. The RMs will simply unbind their registry and create a 
thread to wait for exit since there is no opened transactions and the 
system does not yet implement recovery mechanisms. When control will be 
passed back to the Middleware, it will create a new thread that will wait 
before exiting.

We create this new thread to make sure the client has time to get back an 
answer from the middleware before any of them exists. The solution to this 
specific problem, which appears in figure~\ref{fig:shutdown} was found on 
Stack Overflow\footnote{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/241034/how-to-remotely-shutdown-a-java-rmi-server}.

\begin{figureone}{\java{shutdown} method in RMCar.java (solution from Stack Overflow) \label{fig:shutdown}}
\begin{lstlisting}
  public boolean shutdown() throws RemoteException {
    Trace.info("quit");
    Registry registry = LocateRegistry.getRegistry(port);
    try {
      registry.unbind("Group2RMCar");
      UnicastRemoteObject.unexportObject(this, false);
    } catch (NotBoundException e) {
      throw new RemoteException("Could not unregister service, quiting anyway", e);
    }

    new Thread() {
      @Override
      public void run() {
	Trace.info("Shutting down...");
	try {
	  sleep(2000);
	} catch (InterruptedException e) {
	  // I don't care
	}
	Trace.info("done");
	System.exit(0);
      }

    }.start();
    return true;
  }
\end{lstlisting}
\end{figureone}

Since all transactions are committed before shutdown, the only things
that will stay in persistent storage are the RMs' main hashtable
containing all the items currently handled by the resource manager.
There will not be anything save by the transaction manager since
they only keep in storage informations about ongoing transactions.

On restart after a shutdown, the saved hashtables will be loaded
back into the resource managers' memory and the user will be able
to administer any of the currently existing resource just as
it was before the server shutdown.

\subsection{Crash and Recovery of a Resource Manager\label{sec:recrm}}

As presented above, RMs save their committed data into disk to make
sure they can be recovered from crashes. Most of the time, if a crash
occurs, the current transactions will simply be discarded and any
attempt to commit any of the transactions will lead up to its abortion.

However, to maintain consistency, we need to make sure that, once an RM
has voted to commit, it is able to carry on with this commit even if
a crash would be to happen before it is actually done. To do so, it 
writes the hashtable containing all the changes done during this
transaction to file during the prepare phase, then it sends its vote to
the transaction manager. Hence, if a crash occurs after it sent its
vote, the recovery on boot will reload the changes done by the
transaction into memory and wait for the transaction manager to tell
him what to do with it.

If the resource manager is not available when the transaction manager 
tells it to commit or abort (and so throws a \java{RemoteException}), 
the TM will start a reconnect loop sending the query again at a given
interval until it succeeds or until it raises an \java{InvalidTransactionException}
which indicates the transaction does not exist anymore in the RM.
We note that, in the case of an abort, we simply want to discard the
modifications and so this exception tells us it already has been
discarded. On the other hand, if we want to do a commit, it means
the RM voted yes in the prepare phase and so saved a copy of the 
modifications which are then recovered before making the RM available
again to the middleware. Hence, the transaction will exist and
the exception will not be raised. The only case where this could
fail is if the writing or reading to a file failed which we do not
consider in this project. Thus, the data will remain consistent through
crashes on the RM side.

To be able to resend the query, the transaction manager needs to be able to
reconnect to the resource manager through the RMI interfacce. This is
done through the heartbeat mechanism described in section~\ref{sec:heart}.

\subsubsection{Heartbeat Mechanism\label{sec:heart}}

\begin{figureone}{\java{reconnect} method from the \java{Heartbeat} in Middleware.java \label{fig:heartbeat}}
\begin{lstlisting}
void reconnect(RMType rm) {
  try {
    Registry registry;
    RMBase rmb;
    switch(rm){
      case CAR:
      registry = LocateRegistry.getRegistry(locationRMCar, port);
      rmb = (RMBase) registry.lookup("Group2RMCar");
      if(rmb != null){
	rmb.heartbeat();
	rmCar = (RMCar) rmb;
	tm.updateRMCar(rmCar);
	Trace.info("Middleware::reconnect(" + rm + ") succeeded.");
      } else
      Trace.error("Middleware::reconnect(" + rm + ") failed - The reference was null.");
      break;
    //other cases for different RMs
    }
  } //Catch statements printing only an error message.
\end{lstlisting}
\end{figureone}

We want the middleware to try to reconnect to the resource managers
whenever they go down. To make sure this test is done consistently,
we have a heartbeat mechanism, that is, a thread that will run on
a regular interval and simply call a method that does nothing but
verifies that the connection can be established. If it cannot,
it will try to reconnect once and then go on with the heartbeat.
If the connection fails, then the next beat will try again to reconnect.
The reconnect method is shown in figure~\ref{fig:heartbeat}.

This mechanism allows the transaction manager to go into a reconnect
loop only handling the commit or abort of a specific transaction; Once 
the connection will be established again, the query from the TM will be 
executed and the transaction will be committed or aborted in the RM.

\subsection{Crash and Recovery of the Transaction Manager\label{sec:rectm}}

In order to ensure consistency of transactions in case of crash from the TM,
it saves the necessary data about the existing transaction to file whenever
a modification is done to it. The write to file in \java{writeData} which
also adds to transaction to the hashtable of transactions. The implementation
of \java{writeData} is shown in figure~\ref{fig:writeData}. The informations
written to file are the one contained in the a \java{TransactionData} object
which is a simplified version of an actual transaction object. It contains the
ID, whether it is an autocommitting transaction, a list of the enlisted 
resource managers, whether they answered to a prepare phase and their answer 
to the vote, if they answered. It does not need to know about the TTL or the
timeout status so they appear in the \java{Transaction} object instead of a 
\java{TransactionData} object.

\begin{figureone}{\java{writeData} method in TMImpl.java \label{fig:writeData}}
\begin{lstlisting}
private void writeData(int id, Transaction value) {
  synchronized (transactionHT) {
    transactionHT.put(id, value);
  }
  File file = new File(locationFile(id));
  File directory = new File(folder);
  if (!directory.exists()){ 
    directory.mkdirs();
    Trace.info("TM :: writeData() - Directory not found, creating it now");
  }
  try {
    if (!file.exists())
    file.createNewFile(); 
    FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file);
    ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(fos);

    TransactionData td = value.extractData();
    oos.writeObject(td);
    oos.close();
  } catch (IOException e) {
    // TODO Auto-generated catch block
    e.printStackTrace();
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{figureone}

During recovery after a crash, all existing transactions will be terminated
since we do not have informations to allow the client to make additional
queries to it. This can be explained by the fact that we do not write
locks to file because we believe the overhead for keeping tracks of all
the locks would be too big for the benefits. Hence, on boot, the transaction
manager will read every transaction file and will abort them, unless it
received positive votes from every RM enlisted and can therefore safely
proceed to the commit. If a transaction was autocommitting, it will create
a new transaction object and add it to its list of ongoing transactions
so a client using an autocommitting transaction ID will still be able to
use it.

This cleanup phase will catch possible \java{RemoteException} and will
start a reconnect loop as presented in section~\ref{sec:recrm}. It
will also catch any \java{InvalidTransactionException} which indicates
that the operation has already been done and that there is nothing more
to do. This occurs if the transaction manager crashes while sending
commit or abort instructions to the RMs. In this case, it will try
to do it again because it does not know what RMs actually received
the query. 

The recovery mechanism interacts well with the two-phase commit. If
will go on with the two-phase commit procedure. When it has received
all the votes, it will write them to disk then proceed to the commit
or the abort according to the result of the vote. Thus, if the
transaction manager fails before recording that all the votes have
been received, it will simply abort the transaction. If the
transaction manager fails after recording to file that all
the votes have been received, it will decide whether to commit
or abort based on the result of the vote. In any case, the
data will remain consistent amongst all the resource managers.
%TODO: actually do it and change this sentence
An optimization we could have done is to register to disk
that a vote will occur and if the votes have not been recorded
before the crash, the transaction manager would run the vote again.
However, we did not have time to add it once we realized this was
a possibility.
